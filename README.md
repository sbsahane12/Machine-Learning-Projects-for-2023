# [Project 1: House Price Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/sbsahane12/Machine-Learning-Projects-for-2023.git)
This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a House Price Prediction system for a House dataset.
* Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset 
* The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques. 
* Algorithms Used : Linear Regression Algorithm ,Logistic Regression Algorithm ,Decision Tree,SVM,Na√Øve Bayes,KNN,K-Means Clustering,Random Forest
